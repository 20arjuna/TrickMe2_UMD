# maskifai-server
This repository contains the code for the TrickMe2 Interface.

# Motivation
Current QA models perform poorly on questions centered around underrepresented entities. This is in part due to biases in data that is being used to train these models. This includes underrepresentation of minorities and women, as well as a lack of focus on individuals from nonwestern countries. As QA models continue to perform at higher and higher levels, it is important that the data being used to train these models accurately portrays the diverse world we live in.

# What we built
* Note: Project is still under development

<br>
To rectify this, we propose an adversarial question writing interface with a human-in-the-loop with a specific emphasis on generating questions that either contain or are about underrepresented groups. The end result of this project will be an inclusive dataset that can be used to train existing QA models.
